The [Grassmann.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/Grassmann.jl) package provides tools for computations based on multi-linear algebra and spin groups using the extended geometric algebra known as Grassmann-Clifford-Hodge algebra.
Algebra operations include exterior, regressive, inner, and geometric, along with the Hodge star and boundary operators.
Code generation enables concise usage of the algebra syntax.
[DirectSum.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/DirectSum.jl) multivector parametric type polymorphism is based on tangent vector spaces and conformal projective geometry.
Additionally, the universal interoperability between different sub-algebras is enabled by [AbstractTensors.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/AbstractTensors.jl), on which the type system is built.
The design is based on `TensorAlgebra{V}` abstract type interoperability from *AbstractTensors.jl* with a `K`-module type parameter `V` from *DirectSum.jl*.
Abstract vector space type operations happen at compile-time, resulting in a differential geometric algebra of multivectors.

#### `TensorAlgebra{V}` design and code generation

Mathematical foundations and definitions specific to the [Grassmann.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/Grassmann.jl) implementation provide an extensible platform for computing with a universal language for finite element methods based on a discrete manifold bundle. 
Tools built on these foundations enable computations based on multi-linear algebra and spin groups using the geometric algebra known as Grassmann algebra or Clifford algebra.
This foundation is built on a [DirectSum.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/DirectSum.jl) parametric type system for tangent bundles and vector spaces generating the algorithms for local tangent algebras in a global context.
With this unifying mathematical foundation, it is possible to improve efficiency of multi-disciplinary research using geometric tensor calculus by relying on universal mathematical principles.

### Requirements

*Grassmann.jl* is a package for the [Julia language](https://julialang.org), which can be obtained from their website or the recommended method for your operating system (GNU/Linux/Mac/Windows). Go to [docs.julialang.org](https://docs.julialang.org) for documentation.
Availability of this package and its subpackages can be automatically handled with the Julia package manager `using Pkg; Pkg.add("Grassmann")` or
```Julia
pkg> add Grassmann
```
If you would like to keep up to date with the latest commits, instead use
```Julia
pkg> add Grassmann#master
```
which is not recommended if you want to use a stable release.
When the `master` branch is used it is possible that some of the dependencies also require a development branch before the release. This may include, but not limited to:

This requires a merged version of `ComputedFieldTypes` at https://github.com/vtjnash/ComputedFieldTypes.jl

Interoperability of `TensorAlgebra` with other packages is enabled by [DirectSum.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/DirectSum.jl) and [AbstractTensors.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/AbstractTensors.jl).

## DirectSum.jl parametric type polymorphism

The `AbstractTensors` package is intended for universal interoperation of the abstract `TensorAlgebra` type system.
All `TensorAlgebra{V}` subtypes have type parameter `V`, used to store a `Submanifold{M}` value, which is parametrized by `M` the `TensorBundle` choice.
This means that different tensor types can have a commonly shared underlying `K`-module parametric type expressed by defining `V::Submanifold{M}`.
Each `TensorAlgebra` subtype must be accompanied by a corresponding `TensorBundle` parameter, which is fully static at compile time.
Due to the parametric type system for the `K`-module types, the compiler can fully pre-allocate and often cache.

Let `V` be a `K`-module of rank `n` be specified by instance with the tuple `(n,P,g,ν,μ)` with `P` specifying the presence of the projective basis and `g` is a metric tensor specification.
The type `TensorBundle{n,P,g,ν,μ}` encodes this information as *byte-encoded* data available at pre-compilation,
where `μ` is an integer specifying the order of the tangent bundle (i.e. multiplicity limit of the Leibniz-Taylor monomials).
Lastly, `ν` is the number of tangent variables, bases for the vectors and covectors; and bases for differential operators and scalar functions.
The purpose of the `TensorBundle` type is to specify the `K`-module basis at compile time.
When assigned in a workspace, `V = Submanifold(::TensorBundle)`.

The metric signature of the `Submanifold{V,1}` elements of a vector space `V` can be specified with the `V"..."` by using `+` or `-` to specify whether the `Submanifold{V,1}` element of the corresponding index squares to +1 or -1.
For example, `S"+++"` constructs a positive definite 3-dimensional `TensorBundle`, so constructors such as `S"..."` and `D"..."` are convenient.

It is also possible to change the diagonal scaling, such as with `D"1,1,1,0"`, although the `Signature` format has a more compact representation if limited to +1 and -1.
It is also possible to change the diagonal scaling, such as with `D"0.3,2.4,1"`.
Fully general `MetricTensor` as a type with non-diagonal components requires a matrix, e.g. `MetricTensor([1 2; 2 3])`.

Declaring an additional point at infinity is done by specifying it in the string constructor with `∞` at the first index (i.e. Riemann sphere `S"∞+++"`).
The hyperbolic geometry can be declared by `∅` subsequently (i.e. hyperbolic projection `S"∅+++"`).
Additionally, the *null-basis* based on the projective split for conformal geometric algebra would be specified with `S"∞∅+++"`.
These two declared basis elements are interpreted in the type system.
The `tangent(V,μ,ν)`  map can be used to specify `μ` and `ν`.

To assign `V = Submanifold(::TensorBundle)` along with associated basis
elements of the `DirectSum.Basis` to the local Julia session workspace, it is typical to use `Submanifold` elements created by the `@basis` macro,
```julia
julia> using Grassmann; @basis S"-++" # macro or basis"-++"
(⟨-++⟩, v, v₁, v₂, v₃, v₁₂, v₁₃, v₂₃, v₁₂₃)
```
the macro `@basis V` delcares a local basis in Julia.
As a result of this macro, all `Submanifold{V,G}` elements generated with `M::TensorBundle` become available in the local workspace with the specified naming arguments.
The first argument provides signature specifications, the second argument is the variable name for `V` the `K`-module, and the third and fourth argument are prefixes of the `Submanifold` vector names (and covector names).
Default is `V` assigned `Submanifold{M}` and `v` is prefix for the `Submanifold{V}`.

It is entirely possible to assign multiple different bases having different signatures without any problems.
The `@basis` macro arguments are used to assign the vector space name to `V` and the basis elements to `v...`, but other assigned names can be chosen so that their local names don't interfere:
If it is undesirable to assign these variables to a local workspace, the versatile constructs of `DirectSum.Basis{V}` can be used to contain or access them, which is exported to the user as the method `DirectSum.Basis(V)`.
```julia
julia> DirectSum.Basis(V)
DirectSum.Basis{⟨-++⟩,8}(v, v₁, v₂, v₃, v₁₂, v₁₃, v₂₃, v₁₂₃)
```
`V(::Int...)` provides a convenient way to define a `Submanifold` by using integer indices to reference specific direct sums within ambient `V`.

Additionally, a universal unit volume element can be specified in terms of `LinearAlgebra.UniformScaling`, which is independent of `V` and has its interpretation only instantiated by context of `TensorAlgebra{V}` elements being operated on.
Interoperability of `LinearAlgebra.UniformScaling` as a pseudoscalar element which takes on the `TensorBundle` form of any other `TensorAlgebra` element is handled globally.
This enables the usage of `I` from `LinearAlgebra` as a universal pseudoscalar element defined at every point `x` of a manifold, which is mathematically denoted by `I` = I(x) and specified by the g(x) bilinear tensor field.

Accessing `metrictensor(V)` produces a linear map `g` which can be extended to an outermorphism given by `metricextensor`.
To apply the `metricextensor` to any `Grassmann` element, the function `metric` can be used on the element, `cometric` applies a complement metric.

## Visualization examples

Due to [GeometryBasics.jl](https://github.com/JuliaGeometry/GeometryBasics.jl) `Point` interoperability, plotting and visualizing with [Makie.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) is easily possible. For example, the `vectorfield` method creates an anonymous `Point` function that applies a versor outermorphism:
```Julia

streamplot(vectorfield(exp(π*v12/2)),-1.5..1.5,-1.5..1.5)
streamplot(vectorfield(exp((π/2)*v12/2)),-1.5..1.5,-1.5..1.5)
streamplot(vectorfield(exp((π/4)*v12/2)),-1.5..1.5,-1.5..1.5)
